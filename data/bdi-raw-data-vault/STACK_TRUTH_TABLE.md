# STACK TRUTH TABLE
**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** April 18, 2026
**Authority:** E5 Enclave Incorporated — Board-locked canonical reference
**DAG:** stack-truth-table-v1-2026-0418
**Rule:** When README, manifest, methodology file, or paper language conflicts with this table — THIS TABLE WINS. Update the other file.

## PURPOSE

This document is the single canonical crosswalk that forces every repo to say the same thing about:
- what it is
- what formula it uses
- what universe it covers
- what claims are safe to make publicly

A reviewer will attack inconsistency faster than they attack complexity. This table closes that attack surface.

## LOCKED NUMBERS — CANONICAL PUBLIC CLAIMS

These are the numbers all public language must use. Any document saying something different must be updated to match.

| Claim | Locked value | Source | Notes |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Tracts scored (farmblock-data) | **15,578** | `processed/farmblock_fdi_v2.csv` row count (verified) | |
| Cities ranked (farmblock-data) | **50** | `processed/farmblock_city_rankings.csv` row count (verified) | manifest says 49 — manifest is WRONG, update it |

| `% Black` in tract FDI | **Not included** | `methodology/fdi_manifest.json` | Structural dimensions only |
| `% Black` in county FDI | **15% weight** | `methodology/fdi_methodology_v2.json` | Structural exposure proxy; see race_variable_note.md |

## RECONCILIATION STATUS — KNOWN DRIFTS

| Drift | Location A | Location B | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| City count: 49 vs 50 | `fdi_manifest.json` says 49 | `city_rankings.csv` has 50 actual rows | **50 is correct** (verified row count). Update `fdi_manifest.json` to 49→50. |
| City count: 49/50 vs 53 | `farmblock-data` says 49/50 | `farmblock-dataset` says 53 cities | **Both correct** — these are different city sets for different products. Explicit labeling required. |
| Tract count: 15,578 vs 12,426 | `farmblock-data/fdi_manifest.json`: 15,578 | `farmblock-dataset/fdi_methodology_v2.json`: 12,426 | **Both correct** — different runs, different geographic scope. farmblock-data is the larger authoritative dataset. |
| `% Black` inclusion | Tract FDI: NOT included | County FDI: included at 15% | **Intentional product difference**, not drift. Documented in `race_variable_note.md`. Both correct. |
| Health: direct vs proxy | farmblock-data METHODOLOGY.md says CDC PLACES direct | fdi_methodology_v2.json limitation note mentions proxy | **Phase 2 county formula uses CDC PLACES direct** (verified in phase2 JSON). Proxy was Phase 1 only. Update fdi_methodology_v2.json limitation note. |
| Data points: 1,855 vs 1,574 | README (old) and paper drafts claim 1,855 | Verified JSON count: 1,574 | **1,574 is correct**. BDI_QUANT_SPEC.md has counting rule. All public language must use 1,574. |

## FIXES REQUIRED (files to update after this truth table is committed)

| File | Fix needed | Priority |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `farmblock-data/methodology/fdi_manifest.json` | Update `cities` from 49 → 50 (verified row count) | HIGH |
| `farmblock-dataset/methodology/fdi_methodology_v2.json` | Remove proxy language from Phase 2 health limitation — Phase 2 uses CDC PLACES direct | MEDIUM |
| `bdi-sovereign-dataset/bdi_sovereign_dataset_v1.json` | Update `"mandate"` claim language to use 1,574 not 1,855 | HIGH |
| All paper drafts | Replace "1,855 data points" with "1,574 verified empirical observations" | HIGH |
| `farmblock-data/README.md` | Confirm city count says 50 (matches city_rankings.csv) | LOW |

## PRODUCT A vs PRODUCT B — CANONICAL DESCRIPTIONS

### Product A — BDI National Structural Record
**What it is:** Longitudinal Black structural disparity record. Eight pillars. 1991–2024 empirical window. Historical evidence framing 1514–2024.
**Best outputs:** Annual trend tables, ratio/gap dashboards, pillar summaries, long-arc historical appendix.
**Audience:** Scholars, journalists, litigators, testimony writers, public record.
**Repo:** `bdi-sovereign-dataset`
**Do not conflate with:** FarmBlock FDI, place-level scores, county targeting.

### Product B — BDI / FarmBlock Place Distress Instrument
**What it is:** Operational targeting and prioritization instrument for communities.
**Best outputs:** County/tract/city scores, percentile ranks, pillar subscores, catastrophe-zone designations.
**Audience:** Organizers, grant writers, deployment planners, funders, policy staff.
**Repos:** `farmblock-data` (tract layer) + `farmblock-dataset` (county layer)
**Do not conflate with:** BDI national composite, sovereign record, historical evidence layer.

## CANONICAL PUBLIC LANGUAGE

### Safe to say (source-confirmed)
- "15,578 census tracts scored across 50 priority cities in 17 states"
- "24-county priority pilot release (Phase 2); full national county corpus in preparation"
- "1,574 verified empirical observations across 8 structural pillars, 1991–2024"
- "Historical evidence anchor: 1514–2024 (Slave Voyages aggregate through present)"
- "% Black population included as a structural exposure proxy in the county instrument (15% weight); not included in tract formula"
- "All source data committed unmodified to bdi-raw-data-vault before analysis"
- "CC0 1.0 Universal — public domain, freely reusable"

### Requires respecification before use
- "1,855 data points" → use "1,574 verified empirical observations"
- "dual-source verified" → add citation: "per dual_source_log.json (11 series verified)"
- "largest unified empirical dataset" → use: "largest single CC0-licensed, machine-readable, unified dataset on Black American structural conditions currently in public release"
- Cancer Alley "85% Black" → specify: "65–94% Black at fence-line tract level (St. James Districts 4–5, Convent, Wallace)"
- Incarceration ratio "never below 5.7" → update: "~5.0–5.7 range depending on year and scope (state-only vs. state+federal)"
- NAEP reading gap "down to 20 points / parity in 64 years" → "current gap ~24 pp; linear projection ~120 years to parity"
- Humphreys poverty "37%" → verify subpopulation; ACS 2019–23 all-persons = 26.4%
- "20 years of gains erased in 18 months" (COVID) → "approximately two decades of life expectancy gains erased between 2019 and 2021"
