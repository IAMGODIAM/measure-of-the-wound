# CHAPTER 4 — THE MEASURE: WHAT GETS COUNTED AND WHY

## Opening

Measurement choices are moral choices. What you choose to count, what weight you assign each dimension, and what you decide to leave out of the composite is not a neutral technical exercise. It is an argument about what matters. Every index that has ever been built to measure human conditions — the United Nations Human Development Index, the Gini coefficient, the Federal Poverty Line — encodes a theory of what constitutes deprivation and what threshold marks its presence.

This chapter makes the measurement choices of the BDI explicit. It names the theory behind the weighting. It explains why eight dimensions were chosen and not three or twelve. It documents what the index does not claim to capture. And it argues that the specific combination of dimensions, weights, and data sources assembled here is not arbitrary — it is the minimum necessary architecture to see the wound whole.

## I. Why Eight Dimensions

The decision to organize the BDI around eight structural pillars responds to a specific failure in how Black American structural distress has been measured historically: the single-pillar problem.

The federal government measures Black unemployment (BLS). It measures Black incarceration (BJS). It measures Black maternal mortality (NCHS). Each instrument is rigorous within its lane. None of them communicate with each other. A community can have low unemployment and high incarceration simultaneously. A community can have improving life expectancy and worsening mortgage denial rates simultaneously. The single-pillar instruments are not wrong. They are incomplete. They cannot see the interaction effects.

The academic literature on racial inequality has produced powerful multi-dimensional analyses — Robert Sampson's work on neighborhood effects, Patrick Sharkey's research on urban poverty, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor on predatory inclusion in housing markets. But this scholarship is paywalled, time-bounded by research funding cycles, and produced for academic audiences, not for the communities it describes.

The BDI synthesizes across eight dimensions simultaneously because the lived experience of structural distress is not single-pillar. A family in one of the highest-distress counties ranked in Chapter 7 is not experiencing poverty or health burden or carceral threat — they are experiencing all of these simultaneously, interacting with each other, compounding each other, foreclosing paths out of each other. An instrument that cannot see the compound cannot measure the catastrophe.

## II. The Eight Pillars: Rationale and Evidence

### Pillar 1 — Economic (Weight: 20%)

**What it measures:** Wealth gap, unemployment, household income, homeownership rates, poverty rates.

**Why 20%:** The economic dimension is assigned the highest weight (tied with health and criminal justice) because it is both the most measurable and the most foundational. Wealth is the mechanism through which structural advantage and disadvantage are transmitted across generations. The Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances provides the most rigorous longitudinal measure available. The BLS unemployment series provides the longest continuous racial comparison available in American public data (1972–2025, fifty-four years). Income and homeownership from the Census ACS provide the intermediate layer between wealth accumulation and daily economic survival.

**Key sources:** Fed Reserve SCF (wealth, 1989–2022), BLS CPS (unemployment, 1972–2025), Census ACS B19013 (income), Census ACS B25003 (homeownership), Census ACS B17001 (poverty), BLS LAUS (state-level, 2010–2024), Census ACS county-level 5-year estimates (2015–2022, 12,382 county-year observations).

### Pillar 2 — Health (Weight: 20%)

**What it measures:** Maternal mortality rate, life expectancy gap, COVID excess mortality, environmental health burden.

**Why 20%:** The body is the final ledger of everything the built environment, the economic environment, and the political environment produce. Maternal mortality is not a health failure — it is a system failure. The 69.9 per 100,000 maternal mortality rate for Black women in 2021 — the highest recorded since 1968, documented by NCHS — is a metric that encodes discriminatory clinical treatment, under-resourced prenatal care, environmental stressors, economic precarity, and the cumulative physical burden of navigating anti-Black institutions across a lifetime. Life expectancy encodes the same compound burden in a single number at the population level.

**Key sources:** NCHS WONDER (maternal mortality, 1999–2021), NCHS vital statistics (life expectancy by race, 1999–2021), CDC PLACES (health burden at tract level for FarmBlock layer).

### Pillar 3 — Criminal Justice (Weight: 20%)

**What it measures:** Incarceration rate by race, police killing rate by race, unarmed killing rate.

**Why 20%:** The carceral system is an economic system. Incarceration removes labor from families, destroys wealth-building capacity, removes voting rights in most states, restricts housing access, restricts employment access, and generates lifetime economic penalties that compound across generations. The incarceration ratio — which has moved 0.14 points in ninety-seven years of data, and has not fallen below 5.8 within the empirical window — is not a public safety metric. It is a structural extraction metric. The BJS Prisoners series measures it with the same methodological rigor as any other federal statistical program.

**Key sources:** BJS Prisoners series (incarceration rate by race, 1991–2023), Mapping Police Violence database (police killings by race, 2013–2023, DOJ-confirmed methodology).

### Pillar 4 — Education (Weight: 15%)

**What it measures:** NAEP reading and mathematics score gaps by race, educational attainment rates by race and state.

**Why 15%:** Education is weighted at 15% rather than 20% not because it matters less, but because the causal pathway from structural conditions to educational outcomes is more mediated than in the economic, health, and criminal justice pillars. School funding inequities, environmental stressors in learning environments, and the cumulative cognitive burden of poverty are all documented mechanisms. But the NAEP score gap is a downstream measure of upstream structural failures that are more directly captured in the higher-weighted pillars. The 15% weighting reflects this position in the causal chain, not a diminished importance.

**Key sources:** NAEP (reading and math score gaps by race, 1992–2022), Census ACS B15002 (educational attainment by race, all states, 2022).

### Pillar 5 — Housing (Weight: 10%)

**What it measures:** Mortgage denial rates by race, historical homeownership rates, eviction rates.

**Why 10%:** Housing is the primary mechanism of wealth accumulation for American families without inherited wealth. The mortgage denial ratio — documented by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act — is the most direct federal measure of discriminatory access to this mechanism. The denial ratio, which ranged from 2.01 to 2.36 across thirty years of HMDA reporting and never fell below 2.0, is one of the most durable findings in the dataset. The 10% weighting reflects the significant overlap between housing and economic conditions (Pillar 1): they are measuring different mechanisms of the same fundamental condition of wealth exclusion.

**Key sources:** HMDA (mortgage denial by race, 1995–2022), Census decennial homeownership (1940–2010 historical series), eviction data integrated from available administrative sources.

### Pillar 6 — Environmental (Weight: 10%)

**What it measures:** Proximity to industrial pollution sources, environmental health burden by race and geography.

**Why 10%:** Environmental racism — the pattern by which polluting industrial facilities are sited disproportionately in Black and low-income communities — is documented across decades of environmental justice research and confirmed in federal EPA data. The Louisiana petrochemical corridor — 150 industrial facilities across an 85-mile stretch, with fence-line census tracts 65 to 94 percent Black against a parish-wide share near 44 percent — is the most documented example, but the pattern is national and appears in the FarmBlock data across the 50-city priority universe. The 10% weighting reflects that environmental burden is both a direct health input (it belongs to Pillar 2 in terms of outcomes) and a distinct structural condition in its own right (community geography as a site of intentional disinvestment and industrial siting).

**Key sources:** EPA facility data (industrial siting by community demographics), CDC PLACES environmental burden indicators at tract level.

### Pillar 7 — Political (Weight: 5%)

**What it measures:** Elected representation by race at state and federal levels, voting access indicators.

**Why 5%:** Political representation is weighted at 5% — the lowest weight in the composite — not because political power is unimportant, but because the relationship between representation and structural outcomes is the most complex and least directly measurable in the BDI framework. The empirical record on the relationship between Black political representation and structural conditions in Black communities is contested in ways that the relationships in the other six pillars are not. A lower weight reflects appropriate epistemic humility about what the available data can support.

**Key sources:** Congressional and state legislative representation data by race, voting access indicators from existing civil rights monitoring databases.

### Pillar 8 — Historical (Weight: 0% in composite, full presence in paper)

**What it measures:** The Trans-Atlantic slave trade, 1514–1866 — the origin point.

**Why 0% composite weight:** The historical pillar is not weighted in the BDI composite index because it is not a contemporary condition that varies across the 50-city comparison universe — it is the shared origin of the structural conditions that do. Every community in the priority universe descends from this history. Weighting it in the composite would not differentiate communities; it would add a constant. The historical data is present in the dataset, documented in the vault, and present in this paper because the 33-year empirical window does not explain itself without it. The wealth gap that opens Chapter 5 does not begin in 1991.

**Key sources:** Slave Voyages Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (1514–1866), 42 aggregate observations: 12,521,337 embarked, 10,702,656 disembarked in the Americas, 1,818,681 lost in the crossing.

## III. The BDI Composite Index Formula

The BDI composite score for a given geography (national, state, metro, or county) is calculated as:

```
BDI = (Economic × 0.20) + (Health × 0.20) + (CriminalJustice × 0.20) 
    + (Education × 0.15) + (Housing × 0.10) + (Environmental × 0.10) 
    + (Political × 0.05)
```

Each pillar score is normalized to a 0–100 scale using min-max normalization across the comparison universe before weighting. A BDI score of 100 represents the most extreme structural distress in the comparison universe; a score of 0 represents the least. The composite is not an absolute measure — it is a relative instrument for identifying and ranking the most structurally compromised geographies within the priority universe.

## IV. What the BDI Does Not Measure

**Mental health burden.** The psychological toll of navigating anti-Black institutions — the documented phenomenon of weathering, the elevated cortisol levels and accelerated biological aging associated with chronic racial stress — is real, measurable, and consequential. It is not fully captured in the BDI v1.0 because the tract-level mental health data required to include it with the rigor this instrument demands was not available at time of synthesis. BDI v2.0 must address this.

**Intergenerational wealth transfer.** The Fed Reserve SCF captures current wealth levels. It does not fully capture the compound interest of historical exclusion — the way that the denial of land ownership to Black families during the Homestead Act era, the destruction of the Greenwood District in Tulsa, the targeted displacement of Overtown in Miami, and similar events represent not just historical injuries but compound wealth deficits that accumulate across generations. Quantifying this requires a different kind of modeling than the BDI framework employs.

**Criminal legal debt.** Court fees, fines, and supervision costs constitute a significant mechanism of wealth extraction from Black communities that is not captured in standard incarceration data. The BJS Prisoners series counts people. It does not count the dollar amounts extracted from communities through the criminal legal system. This is a gap.

**Sub-county variation.** The sovereign dataset covers national, state, MSA, and county levels. The FarmBlock layer addresses the census tract. The gap between county and tract — the neighborhood level, the school district level, the block level — is partially addressed but not fully resolved.

These gaps are documented because a sovereign empirical record that conceals its limitations is not sovereign — it is promotional. The findings of this paper stand on what the data does show. They are sufficient.

## V. The Transition

Chapter 3 described how the data was built. Chapter 4 has described what it measures and why.

Part Three begins with the findings. Thirty-three years. The wealth gap that has never closed. The unemployment ratio that has never once inverted in fifty-four years. The maternal mortality ratio that is wider today than it was under legal segregation.

The data is ready. The architecture is described. The methodology is documented.
